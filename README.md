>*hello world !*

&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to find something ***brightness*** in coding with friends, so that we can finish something that may be  
**interesting**  
and  
**Magnificent**.

&nbsp;&nbsp; just try and try ! 记录下你的代码`print hello`就像下面这样。

```python
print("hello, world !")
```

就是这么interesting.
